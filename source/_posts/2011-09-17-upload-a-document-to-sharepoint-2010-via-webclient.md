Hereâ€™s some code on how to upload a document into Sharepoint 2010. This works accross domains:

    WebClient wc = new WebClient();
    wc.Credentials = loginCredentials;
    wc.UploadData(destinationUrl, "PUT", fileData);

A big FYI. The Copy.asmx web service will **NOT** work across domains. Using the above method will work for all occasions (of course the only issue is that you need to update the columns in a separate call.
