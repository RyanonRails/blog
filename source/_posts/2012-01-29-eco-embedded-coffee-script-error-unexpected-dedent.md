Ran into this error when testing out eco (Embedded Coffee Script) templates.

Parse error on line #: unexpected dedent  
(in c:/project/app/assets/javascripts/backbone/templates/dartboard.jst.eco)

Broken code:

     3 %>
      teststring
    

Fixed Code:

     3: %>
      teststring
    

Notice the colon, this is telling coffeescript that the next line is indented. Itâ€™s document here: [https://github.com/sstephenson/eco][1] it had just slipped my mind.
