Code reviews are a pain. They take time away from development, disrupt workflow, and can even hurt developer's feelings. However,
 I think we can all agree that they're a necessary part of life, and that if we **DIDN'T** do them, we'd
 be in a worse situation.

When I started at AMA I noticed that there wasn't a huge amount of comments on any of the pull requests that were going up
 to production. It didn't matter if the pull request had 1-2 lines of changes, or 100's. That seemed odd, because
 out on the internet this isn't really a problem. Developers seemingly love to bash/1up other developers when it comes to
 tools, methodologies or the technology they're using. We see this all the time when [a new feature gets added to rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/9333ca7...23aa7da)
 or [dhh states that "tdd is dead"](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html).

A local team is different. If you call the guy across from you a numbskull there's nothing stopping him from reaching
 out and bopping you one. I was able to work with the team (through 1 on 1's and team meetings) and I came up with
 the following list of problems.

1. Everyone had their own coding style and didn't want to press that on other developers
2. No one wanted to hurt other team member's feelings
3. Some didn't feel that they were on the same skill levels as others
4. No one wanted to be "the one" that was holding up code from going to production

Once we had narrowed down what was causing the issue we could start to work through each of the scenarios.

**Everyone had their own coding style and didn't want to press that on other developers.**
 This was pretty easy to address. We ..

**No one wanted to hurt other team member's feelings.**
 Once you accept that we all write bad code and we all make mistakes, you can start to focus on improving.
